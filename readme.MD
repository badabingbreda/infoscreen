# Infoscreen

Infoscreen is a JS miniwebsite that can be used to render on a flatscreen, doubling as an event or calendar overview. It auto refreshes and uses the following libraries:

 - jQuery
 - Nunjucks
 - GSAP
 - Momentjs
 - UIkit

It's primary use is to enable the creation of Nunjucks-templates that render on each call, handled by a setTimeout callback.
